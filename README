Basic build/setup instructions for testing
------------------------------------------

Using Eclipse (it should also work in NetBeans but I dunno the details for
that), you can set it up as follows:

1) put all the code into eclipse project
2) right-click on build.xml and 'run ant build' (this creates the 'gen' folder)
3) right-click on project and choose 'refresh' (this makes eclipse notice it)
4) right-click on 'gen' folder and choose 'add to source path'

after that it should work, to run it right-click on DevServer.java and choose 
'run as... java application' (I think I hard-coded in my own machine's name so 
maybe need to change that first); that will run the services in the built-in 
Java 6 test server.

Or, you can run unit tests by right-click on the 'test' folder and choose 
'Run as... JUnit test'.
